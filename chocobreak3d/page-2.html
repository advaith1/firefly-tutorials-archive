			<p>As was said before, the window you see on the screen is called the&nbsp;<strong>Storyboard editor</strong>. It displays a thumbnail of the&nbsp;<strong>frames</strong>&nbsp;in your application. Frames can be thought of as "playfields", parts or as the&nbsp;<strong>levels</strong>&nbsp;of you&nbsp;<strong>game</strong>.<br>
			You could also say it shows the different&nbsp;<strong>slides</strong>&nbsp;of your&nbsp;<strong>presentation</strong>, if that is what you were creating. You will understand how it works at the end of this tutorial. For the moment, I want you to click one button:</p>

			<p>Locate you mouse on the big "1" button in the Storyboard window. And click.</p>
