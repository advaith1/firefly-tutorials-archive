			<p>OK, what we want to create is a breakout-style game. In a breakout game, you typically have a ball, a bat, and some bricks. In this tutorial, we want to create a super breakout game, with impressive graphics, made in 3D.</p>

			<p>First, unlike a 2d game where everything has already been setup by fusion, for a 3d game we need to setup a few things ourselves such as where in the world our 3d game will happen, where will the camera man stand and where are all the 3d objects going to start.</p>

			<p>Luckily the Fusion Team have created an extension to help with all of that, so find the extension called Firefly and install it. Once installed it will add some new firefly objects that we can use. Firefly itself consists of a main engine and then loads of little node objects that each do different things, I will list them all here now - but dont worry too much about them or what they do as we will try to cover most of them in a later stage.Wow, thats an awful lot of new objects to learn and understand but not to worry we will try and gradually bring them in so you understand what they are and what they do and more importantly how to make them do what you want them to do.</p>

						<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Node Camera</strong>&nbsp;object is necessary to draw anything to the Frame. It works similarly to how the Engine object works, except the area covered by the Camera object dictates where to draw the scene to (through the camera). Through this system, split-screen effects can be achieved, but usually the Engine object and your singular Camera will both be at the same point on the Frame and both be of the same size.</p>

						<p>With the&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Node Animated Mesh</strong>&nbsp;node you can insert an animated mesh into the scene. An Animated Mesh is animated across a number of Frames by calculating the position, scale, and rotation of the mesh's Joints using each one's collection of Key Frames across those Frames.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						So, an Animated Mesh might have many Joints, and each Joint can have many Key Frames of a Position and/or Scale and/or Rotation type. When the animation takes place, it calculates what Position, Scale, and Rotation each Joint should be set to at a given Frame by working out each difference between the last and next Key Frame.</p>

						<p>With the&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Node Particle System</strong>&nbsp;you can insert a particle emitter into the scene. A Particle System node can be one of these types: Point, Box, Sphere, Animated Mesh Node, Cylinder, Mesh, Ring. These types describe the shape of the emitter. What is actually emitted is similar to a Billboard node object.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						A Particle System Node also can one or more Affecters. An Affecter is something located at a X,Y,Z position within the scene and will affect particles generated by the node object in different ways. The different types of Affecters are 'Attraction', 'Fade-Out', 'Gravity', 'Rotation', 'Scale'.</p>

						<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Counter</strong>&nbsp;object : as its name indicates, this object holds numerical values and, at your option, displays it on the Frame.

You can&nbsp;<strong>add to</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>subtract from</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>set</strong>&nbsp;a counter.</p>

						<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>&nbsp;: In the counter's  Properties, you can set the starting value, as well as the highest and lowest numbers it will be able to work with.
