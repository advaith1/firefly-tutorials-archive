			<p>OK, what we want to create is a breakout-style game. In a breakout game, you typically have a ball, a bat, and some bricks. In this tutorial, we want to create a super breakout game, with impressive graphics, made in 3D.</p>

			<p>The first few things every 3d game needs is a world and a camera to look around the world in. For the world we need to add a Firefly Engine object as that powers the world. from the menus select Insert then select New Object, from the list select&nbsp;<strong>Firefly</strong>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Engine</strong></p>
