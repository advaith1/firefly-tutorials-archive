			<p>OK, let's drop our first objects. Every object in Firefly is classed as a&nbsp;<strong>Node</strong>&nbsp;and you can have many different types of node, however the main ones will be&nbsp;<strong>Primitive Nodes</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Static Mesh Nodes</strong>, the first thing our breakout game needs is a floor, a floor is just a flat surface so we can use a&nbsp;<strong>Primitive Node</strong>&nbsp;for that as we dont need to model something special. just like we did with the other firefly objects add a&nbsp;<strong>Primitive Node</strong>&nbsp;to your world.</p>

			<p>As we will have a few primitive nodes it might get confusing so we will rename this node&nbsp;<strong>Floor</strong>&nbsp;you could of course call it anything you wish, right mouse the node and choose&nbsp;<strong>Rename</strong></p>

			<br>
			Now that we know what settings are best for our game change them in your game by setting the tile settings to 400x400 and 1x1.&nbsp;<strong>Run the Frame</strong>&nbsp;to see your floor in the world.</td>

			<td colspan="3">Oh dear, the floor is black, but dont worry we'll get to that in a minute, firstly lets explain about the camera setting Field of View (FOV for short) setting,&nbsp;how much of the scene the camera can see at once. A&nbsp;<em>wide-angle</em>&nbsp;lens gives a wider field of view, but you have to be closer to things to be able to see them, and there is also greater perspective distortion. At the other extreme, a&nbsp;<em>telephoto</em>lens gives a very narrow field of view,&nbsp;but can take pictures of things from much further away. while its not exactly a zoom it can be used like one, but be careful as rotating cameras with a FOV with high or low FOV values can cause motion sickness.</td>

In 3D everything you see is given a material and/or a texture. which tells the engine what colour everything should be and what  Properties such as reflectivity and opacity to make things. In&nbsp;<strong>Firefly</strong>&nbsp;we use a&nbsp;<strong>Material Cache</strong>&nbsp;add a new object from the menu and select&nbsp;<strong>Material Cache</strong>.</td>
