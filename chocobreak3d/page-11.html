			<td colspan="3">so now we have it in the right place how do we go about rotating it, now you might be thinking that you can see a Rotation X value, so you could just set it to 1 and away it goes, well your right in the fact that will rotate it - however it will only do it once at the start of the Frame, what we need to do is setup something that&nbsp;<strong>Always</strong>&nbsp;rotates it by 1. So go back to the event viewer. Double click on&nbsp;<strong>New Condition</strong>&nbsp;Choose the&nbsp;<strong>Special</strong>&nbsp;icon which looks like a cog, and select&nbsp;<strong>Always</strong>.&nbsp;Now its time to set its rotation every Frame, like we did before&nbsp;<strong>Right Mouse</strong>&nbsp;the box under the&nbsp;<strong>Left Pole</strong>&nbsp;and level with&nbsp;<strong>Always</strong>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>Node  Properties</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Rotation</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Set Z Angle.</strong></td>

			<p>In the expression window we need to tell it what angle we want to rotate as a number, so if we were to write +1 the Red light will stay on as +1 isnt a real number but what we can do is say whatever the rotation is now + 1, so how do we do that ? remember how we picked a material out of the material cache by right mousing its icon. we can do the same every object only instead of a material we can pick a number, in our case the left poles current Z angle. so right mouse the&nbsp;<strong>Left Pole</strong>&nbsp;select&nbsp;<strong>Node  Properties</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Rotation</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Get Z Angle</strong>.</p>
