			<p>Previously we added the&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Engine</strong>, a&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Camera</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Sky</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>uptill now we have only used the default settings for the camera, while good enough to start they wont work all the time, so it's time too look at <strong>Vectors</strong>&nbsp;when we are working in 3D space we use vectors such as 0,0,0 or 0,200,-275</p>

			<p><strong>What are these weird 0,0,0 things you are talking about ?&nbsp;</strong>good question ! i'm sure you know about the standard 2D locations such as 4,5 meaning 4 across the X axis and 5 Up the Y Axis.</p>

			<p>Those as i'm sure you know are called co-ordinates, when we talk about 3D co-ordinates we use what are called&nbsp;<strong>Vectors</strong>, dont worry they work just the same as 2D co-ordinates except they have a 3rd entry called Z.</p>

			<p>It's easy to think of the 3 axis as X = left and right, Y = up and down and Z = forwards and backwards.</p>

			<p>So how does all that information help us ? in our world we need to position objects where we want them, you could place the camera wherever you want in the world using those 3 values, however for our Breakout clone the best place is 0,200,-275. with an X of 0 it will be in the centre of our world, with a Y of 200 it will be placed 200 world units high and with a Z of -275&nbsp;it will be placed backwards 275 world units. click on the&nbsp;<strong>Firefly Node - Camera</strong>&nbsp;and look at the first property tab and set the X to 0 the Y to 200 and the Z to -275.</p>
